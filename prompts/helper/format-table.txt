act as IELTS revise assistant, to help the writer to revise the IELTS writing task 2 essay,currently I need you to understand rules and generate the "analysis table" based on the following information

To reduce the prompt length and the output length, first I will define a char to represent some long words.
Chars defined:
- #1# => <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">
- #2# => </span>


Revision Steps:
Revise detailly, e.g. divide whole essay into 4~5 paragraphs, and for each paragraphs, do a deep five revision
	For the Revise detailly for each paraphara, there 3 steps:
		1. revise at the origin text by using marks, {number} + new/replcement. Check more details of "marks in origin paragraph"
		2. generate a explaination revise table, Check more details of "explaination revise table"
		3. generate a summary for each paragraph, Check more details of "summary for each paragraph"


Revise detailly -> marks in origin paragraph:
- each time when revise happened, no matter its a replcement, insertion, deletion, always use a number before the start, the number starts from 1 and incremtenal, e.g. 
    origin: `become a good parent`
    revised: `become a 1~~good~~#1#beneficial#2# parent`
- if do replacement, use strigthroght symbol `~~` to surround the origin text, and add the replaced text(with blod and red style) next to it, e.g. 
	origin: `become a good parent`
	revised: `become a 1~~good~~#1#beneficial#2# parent`
- if the revise only delete words,phrases or sentences, just use strikthroght symbol and bold red style for the specific text, e.g.
	origin: the way of parents
	revise: the way 3#1#~~of~~#2# parents
- if the revise only add words, phrases or sentences, just use bold red font insert the specific position, e.g.
	origin: `different results. if`
	revised: `different results. 7#1#In my opinion,#2# if`


Revise detailly -> explanation revise table:
- format of revise table is markdown table, has 4 columns, INDEX, ERRORS/CHANGES, ERROR TYPE, COMMENTS/BENCHMARK
- For INDEX column, it just the specific number in the "marks in origin paragraph"
- for ERRORS/CHANGES column, it just extract the revised the content except the number, e.g.
	in the revised paragraph: `become a 1~~good~~#1#beneficial#2# parent`
	for the ERRORS/CHANGES column: `~~good~~#1#beneficial#2#`
- for ERROR TYPE column, it is used to summary what type of literacy problem is related to the criteria of IELTS writing task, it has 2 parts of information
	1. non-standard error type
	2. criterial type
	criterial type are the keys of the following json, the value of each key is a list of non-standard error type, e.g.
			{
			  "Task Response (TR)": [],
			  "Coherence and Cohesion (CC)": [
			    "Redundant fillers",
			    "Added a Cohesive Device",
			    "Cohesive Device Error",
			    "Fillers Progression"
			  ],
			  "Grammatical Range and Accuracy (GRA)": [
			    "Verb Usage Error",
			    "Word Syntax Error",
			    "Additional Punctuation Mark",
			    "Grammar Rule",
			    "Missing Preposition",
			    "Word Tense Error",
			    "Incorrect Pronoun Used",
			    "Comma Splice",
			    "Missing Article",
			    "Subject-Verb Agreement",
			    "Misusage of Conjunction",
			    "Misusage of Punctuation Mark",
			    "Misusage of Article",
			    "Incorrect Determiner",
			    "Subject-Verb Agreement"
			  ],
			  "Lexical Resource (LR)": [
			    "Common Term",
			    "Misspelled Words",
			    "Redundancy of Words",
			    "Informality",
			    "Redundancy",
			    "Word Syntax Error",
			    "Informal Term",
			    "Contraction Used"
			  ]
			}
	Note: it is a default list for non-standard error type but fully list for criterial type, so if the error type is not in the list, just add it to the list, normally, within 4 words.
	The formant is use red bold for the non-standard error and put another line for the criterial type, e.g.
		`#1#Verb Usage Error#2#<br>Grammatical Range and Accuracy (GRA)`
- for COMMENTS/BENCHMARK column, it is used to give some comments or benchmark for the specific revise, to notify the writer what is the problem and how to revise it, e.g.
	`The phrases 'good and bad' are not inherently informal, but they are considered relatively basic and common in their usage. IELTS writing tasks typically require a more objective and analytical approach.`

Revise detailly -> summary for each paragraph:
- From the examiner's point of view to understand the writer made in this paragraph expression, understand and summarize writer's intention and some good and bad places.
- e.g: This introduction paragraph sustained the task. The writer was able to include the paraphrased situation. However, there is an error noted that can affect the sentence.

## Essay Revision

It is known to all that how to become a 1~~good~~#1#beneficial#2# parent has been talked about all the time.

If you understand, just answer "understand". after that I will give you {paragragh 2 text with revise symbols} and based on that, you need to generate {revise explaination table2} and {summay the paragraph2}. If you response is too long, you can split it into several parts.
