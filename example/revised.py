        1: "There is no doubt that children are not just a diversion from more important work – they are the most crucial work. It is well-understood that the way parents educate their children significantly impacts their development. While some believe parents should provide everything that their children desire, others argue that not setting limits can harm their growth. I believe the optimal approach is for parents to set appropriate boundaries on children’s requests but also listen to their wishes to help them choose what is right and fulfilling.",
        2: "The main reason for those who think it is necessary to limit children’s demands is that such restrictions are beneficial for children’s growth, including their health and education. This is because parents generally aim to guide their children correctly. With these limitations, parents have a better opportunity to help their children avoid bad habits that are not conducive to their development. For instance, if some children love eating sugary foods and dislike brushing their teeth, the lack of parental intervention can lead to tooth decay, which is worse than not eating sweets. However, if parents enforce restrictions, children can maintain good health and possibly excel academically in the future. Thus, it is crucial for parents to impose certain limits.",
        3: "Admittedly, some might argue that too much restriction on children’s choices can prevent them from enjoying a happy life. They contend that children who can choose freely are likely to have a happier childhood and a brighter future. If children are allowed to do whatever they want, they might discover their passions early and experience significant happiness. Once they identify their interests at a young age, they have a better chance of succeeding in these areas as they grow older, especially if they have more time to learn and practice relevant skills. Consider the example of tech innovators like Elon Musk, who developed his interests in computing and gaming early in life, and now he has become a leading figure in multiple technological fields.",
        4: "In conclusion, although setting limits on children’s desires can help them avoid many unhealthy habits, it might also dampen their happiness and suppress their interests. In my view, parents should strive for a balance in imposing constraints on their children's choices. They should allow children to pursue what they enjoy while also steering them towards appropriate behavior, thus ensuring a happy, healthy, and successful future."
