		"1": "No doubt that children are not a distraction from more important work; they are the most important work. It is true that parents' education of children has a great influence on children’s growth. Some people hold the view that parents should provide everything that the children want, while others argue that it is harmful for children’s growth if parents don’t limit children’s desires. I believe that the best approach is for parents to set proper limitations on children’s desires while also listening to their voices to help them choose the 'correct' and happy things.",
		"2": "The main reason for people who think it is necessary to limit children’s desires is that restrictions are beneficial to children’s growth, including their health and academic performance. This is because all parents want to guide their children in a way that is beneficial to them. With limitations, parents have more opportunities to help children avoid bad habits that are not conducive to their growth. For example, some children are fond of eating sugary foods and may neglect dental hygiene. If parents do not intervene in their daily habits, they may develop tooth decay and have to visit the dentist, which is more detrimental than abstaining from sugary foods. However, if parents impose restrictions on their habits, children can maintain good health and excel in their studies, possibly leading to admission to a reputable university in the future. Therefore, parents need to limit children's activities to ensure they make the correct choices.",
		"3": "Undoubtedly, some people argue that children cannot lead a happy life if parents impose too many restrictions on their choices. They believe that children who have the freedom to choose what they like can have a happier childhood and a brighter future. If children have the freedom to do whatever they desire, they can discover their interests early and experience a lot of joy. Once they discover their interests at a young age, they have a greater chance of achieving success in those areas as they grow older, as they can dedicate much more time to learning and practicing the necessary skills than other children. As we all know, many technological geniuses discovered their passions at a young age; for example, Elon Musk had an interest in computers and games at the age of 10, gaining a wealth of knowledge in these areas. Now he is a leading figure in multiple technological fields. Therefore, allowing children to choose their own paths is crucial and valuable.",
		"4": "In conclusion, while limitations on children’s desires can help them avoid many unhealthy habits, they can also deprive children of a happy childhood and stifle their interests. From my perspective, parents should strike a balance in setting limitations on children’s desires. They should allow children to pursue their interests while also guiding them in the right direction, ensuring that children have a happy, healthy, and prosperous future."
